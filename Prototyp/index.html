    <h2>Nintendos History</h2>
        <h3>1889-1970</h3>
            <p>
                Nintendo was founded on september 23rd 1889 as a japanese playing card company. <br> In the 1970s they first
                started producing video games. <br> 
                Their first consoles released in 1977 and were named Color TV Game 6 and Color TV Game 15 in Japan exclusively.
            </p>
        <h3>1970–1983</h3>
            <p>
                The 1980 release Game and Watch was their first worldwide success. <br>
                In 1983 their first home console the Famicom was released in Japan, it was later released in Europe and America under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). <br>
                Famous Game Series like Super Mario, Donkey Kong or The Legend of Zelda originated on this Console.
                 
            </p>
        <h3>1983–1989</h3>
            <p>
                In 1989 their biggest success the Gameboy released with games like Tetris and Pokémon. <br>
                It strengths were the handyness and the long battey lifespan, on the other hand the Gameboy had a colorless screen and no backlight so you had to have a external light to play in the night. <br>
                Both issues were fixed in seperate later versions. Only in Japan there was a Gameboy Color Light released. <br>
                The late 1980s marked the slip of Nintendo's dominance in the video game market with the appearance of Sega's Mega drive and NEC's PC Engine. <br>
                They had a 16-bit architecture which allowed for improvement in sound and graphics compared to the Nintendo Entertainment System. <br>
                In response to that competition Nintendo designed the Super Famicom and launched it in 1990. <br>
                The next year a modified version of the Super Famicom was released to the United States market the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). <br>

            </p>
        <h3>1989- 1998</h3>
            <p>
                In mid-1993, Nintendo and some other companies announced an alliance to develop the Nintendo 64.<br>
                The Nintendo 64 was one of the first console to be made with a 64-bit architecture.
                388 games were produced for the Nintendo 64 in total, some of which – particularly Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and GoldenEye 007 have been agreed on to be some of the greatest games of all time. <br>
                In 1995 Nintendo released the Virtual Boy, a virtual reality console, which was a total flop, because the images were only black and red, also the players got massive headaches from playing. <br>
                On October the 4th 1997 Game Boy and Metroid creator Gunpei Yokio died in a car accident. <br>
                Later that same Year the first Pokémon games released, further expanding the Gameboys lifespan. <br>
                In 1998 Nintendo released a special version of the Game Boy called the Game Boy Color which had a colored display. <br>
            </p>
        <h3>1998 - 2009</h3>
            <p>
                In 2001 another Game Boy called the Game Boy Advance was released, which had better technology and new games. <br>
                Later that year the next home console the Gamecube was released in Japan. <br>
                Because the rival consoles Playstation 2 and Xbox had much more sales, the Gamecube didn't get much 3rd party support (games developed by other companies). <br>
                In 2005 Nintendo released a completely new handheld console called the Nintendo DS. <br>
                It had about the same power as the N64 and sold very well. <br>
                It also got online support in 2005, which allowed you to play games like Mario Kart with other people from around the world. <br>
                Their new console the Wii (released in 2006) had a pretty unique concept, the controller was an remote which had sensores that allowed the console to track your movement. <br>
                Unlike the Gamecube it managed to beat the rival companies Sony and Microsoft. <br>
                In 2009 the Wii and DS had a Market value of 48 % (Wii) and 68 % (DS). <br>
            </p>
        <h3>2010 - present</h3>
            <p>
                Like the Game Boy the Nintendo DS also got a successor called the 3DS, it was able to play all DS Games and the new games could be played in 3D. <br>
                In 2011 they held the first Nintendo Direct, which is a press conference where they reveal new games. <br>
                A few new 3DS versions like the 3DS XL (a bigger version) or the 2DS (a cheaper version without 3D) released. <br>
                In 2012 the Wii U was released and against the name says, it was a whole new console and the addition was a touchscreen on the main controller called GamePad. <br>
                On the 11th of July 2015 the Nintendo president Satoru Iwata died of cancer at the age of 55. Tatsumi Kimishima became the new president. <br>
                Nintendo started to develop some mobile games, one of them called Pokémon GO became a huge success and earned Nintendo a lot of Money. <br>
                The next year their current console the Nintendo Switch released. <br>
                It is a hybrid console which can be used as a home console or a handheld. <br>
                In 2018 the president Kimishima retired and was replaced by Shuntarō Furukawa. <br>
