                        Super Mario is Nintendos most known video game franchise featuring Mario as mascot of the
                        company. Mario
                        is an italian plumber <br>
                        who lives in a world called the Mushroom Kingdom. Most of the games belong to the genre of Jump
                        and Runs
                        which means <br>
                        you have to run through levels full of obstacles and enemies. The first game where he can be
                        seen was
                        the 1981 released <br>
                        Donkey Kong where he was called Jump Man. It was an arcade game where Mario had to rescue the
                        princess
                        Pauline from an <br>
                        gorilla called Donkey Kong. Mario's iconic look came from the Technical limitations which made
                        it hard
                        to animate his running.<br>
                        After the game's success, Jump Man was reidd to Mario and gave the franchise's first game “Super
                        Mario
                        Bros” its id. <br>
                        The levels had a completely different design and the main antagonist was changed to Bowser who
                        is a
                        giant turtle. <br>
                        After some more 2D games the series made the step to 3D with Super Mario 64 in 1996. Because the
                        games
                        were so successful Nintendo<br>
                        started to release a lot of Spin offs like Mario Kart and Mario Party. <br>

                        The Legend of Zelda which is just called Zelda most of the Time is also a very big game
                        franchise from
                        Nintendo. <br>
                        Since 1986 a total of 19 main story games were release to the public. Just like the Super Mario
                        series
                        it was invented by the<br>
                        Nintendo employee Shigeru Myamoto. The setting is a fictional middle-aged world called Hyrule
                        where you
                        play the Hero called Link.<br>
                        His mission is to rescue the Princess Zelda who has been kidnapped by the main antagonist Ganon.
                        They
                        are also fighting over<br>
                        the Triforce a legendary Artefact which has unlimited power. You play on an overworld which is
                        freely
                        explorable and full<br>
                        of different characters, villages and dungeons. The currency in this world are rubies and you
                        can buy
                        different items like<br>
                        healing and weapons with it. Its one of the games that has been on almost every Nintendo
                        console. In
                        1986 the first game<br>
                        was released on the NES and because of the technical limitation the game didn't tell what to do
                        most of
                        the time which made<br>
                        it very hard. The most successful game of the series is also the newest called Breath of the
                        Wild. As
                        the id suggests<br>
                        this game put a lot of focus on exploring the huge open world (means you can go where you want)
                        which is
                        one of the biggest, <br>
                        in all the existing open world games. The game is also very long and features tons of side
                        quests. The
                        games evolved a lot <br>
                        over the time from 1986 to now. Most of the modern games are in 3D and let you turn the camera
                        freely
                        while the old ones were <br>
                        played from a top-down view in 2D.<br>

                        mobile game called Pokémon Go was released which became a huge success. The majority of the

                        Kirby is another one of Nintendo's Jump and Run series. The Protagonist is Kirby who is a round
                        pink
                        creature. His ability is <br>
                        to suck up enemies and copy their abilities which makes the games different from the Super Mario
                        games.
                        It was invented by <br>
                        Masahiro Sakurai who is also responsible for the Super Smash Bros series. It is published by
                        Nintendo
                        and produced by HAL <br>
                        Laboratory. The first game was released in 1992 and was called Kirby's Dream Land. The objective
                        is to
                        retrieve the sparkling <br>
                        stars which were stolen by the antagonist king Dedede. Back then Kirby hadn't got his iconic
                        pink colour
                        and was still white. <br>
                        Just like Pokémon it also got an anime. After the success of the Jump and Run Games the series
                        was
                        extended to feature a lot <br>

                    <p>
                        Unlike all the previous games Animal Crossing doesn't really have a story. It's a relatively
                        laid back
                        game where you travel to <br>

                        build new shops, get <br>

                        either donate them to the museum or sell them to earn money. The games are very popular even

                        people who usually don't play <br>
                        many video games especially in Japan. The first came was released in 2001 on the Nintendo 64 in
                        Japan
                        only. The European release <br>
                        was 3 years later on the Gamecube because they had to adjust all the holidays which you could
                        celebrate

                        Smash Bros is a fighting game which unlike all the other games doesn't have its own characters.
                        Instead,
                        it acts as a game where <br>
                        Nintendo most know characters can fight each other. However, as the franchise grew bigger a lot
                        of
                        character from other studios <br>
                        started to appear in smash. A few examples are Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog, Sans from
                        Undertale or
                        Steve from Minecraft. As of <br>
                        17.11.2020 there are 81 characters in the newest game called Super Smash Bros Ultimate with 6

                        Just like Kirby it was also developed by Masahiro Sakurai which means that when a new game is
                        announced,
                        Kirby is usually the first <br>
                        character to be seen. The games started in 1999 on the Nintendo 64. Back then there were only 12
                        playable characters. The games have <br>
                        a very active E-Sports community because of the very competitive gameplay. But this scene was
                        struck by
                        a huge scandal which involved <br>
                        many of the competitive players. A lot of them had very strange relationships with younger

                        Splatoon is one of Nintendo's the newest game series and it belongs to the genre of third-person
                        shooter
                        which is very uncommon for Nintendo. <br>
                        It has very unique gameplay because unlike most shooters you don't use regular guns. Instead
                        paint guns
                        are being used. The goal is to <br>
                        paint more of the map in your own colour that the enemy team. You are able to hide inside your
                        own paint
                        and restore your ammo that way. <br>
                        Enemy paint damages you. Yet there have been two Splatoon games. The first game was released in
                        2015 on
                        the Wii U. Even though the <br>
                        games were very good and popular and a lot of people played them, because they were online games
                        they
                        suffered from Nintendo poor online <br>
                        service which turned many players down over time. But the games still have a very active
