                        Nintendo was founded on september 23rd 1889 as a japanese playing card company.In the 1970s they
                        first started producing <br>
                        video games. Their first consoles released in 1977 and were idd Color TV Game 6 and Color TV
                        Game 15
                        in Japan exclusively. <br>

                        The 1980 release Game and Watch was their first worldwide success. In 1983 their first home
                        console
                        the Famicom was released <br>
                        in Japan, it was later released in Europe and America under the id Nintendo Entertainment System
                        (NES). Famous Game Series <br>
                        like Super Mario, Donkey Kong or The Legend of Zelda originated on this Console. <br>

                        In 1989 their biggest success the Gameboy released with games like Tetris and Pokémon. It
                        strengths
                        were the handyness and <br>
                        the long battey lifespan, on the other hand the Gameboy had a colorless screen and no backlight
                        so
                        you had to have a external <br>
                        light to play in the night. Both issues were fixed in seperate later versions. Only in Japan
                        there
                        was a Gameboy Color Light <br>
                        released. The late 1980s marked the slip of Nintendo's dominance in the video game market with
                        the
                        appearance of Sega's Mega <br>
                        drive and NEC's PC Engine. They had a 16-bit architecture which allowed for improvement in sound
                        and
                        graphics compared to the <br>
                        Nintendo Entertainment System. In response to that competition Nintendo designed the Super
                        Famicom
                        and launched it in 1990. <br>
                        The next year a modified version of the Super Famicom was released to the United States market
                        the
                        Super Nintendo Entertainment <br>
                        System (SNES). <br>

                        In mid-1993, Nintendo and some other companies announced an alliance to develop the Nintendo
                        64.The
                        Nintendo 64 was one of the <br>
                        first console to be made with a 64-bit architecture. 388 games were produced for the Nintendo 64
                        in
                        total, some of which – particularly <br>
                        Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and GoldenEye 007 have been agreed on to be
                        some of the greatest games of all time. <br>
                        In 1995 Nintendo released the Virtual Boy, a virtual reality console, which was a total flop,
                        because the images were only black <br>
                        and red, also the players got massive headaches from playing. On October the 4th 1997 Game Boy
                        and
                        Metroid creator Gunpei Yokio <br>
                        died in a car accident. Later that same Year the first Pokémon games released, further expanding
                        the
                        Gameboys lifespan. In 1998 <br>
                        Nintendo released a special version of the Game Boy called the Game Boy Color which had a
                        colored
                        display. <br>

                        In 2001 another Game Boy called the Game Boy Advance was released, which had better technology
                        and
                        new games. Later that year the <br>
                        next home console the Gamecube was released in Japan. Because the rival consoles Playstation 2
                        and
                        Xbox had much more sales, the <br>
                        Gamecube didn't get much 3rd party support (games developed by other companies). In 2005
                        Nintendo
                        released a completely new handheld <br>
                        console called the Nintendo DS. It had about the same power as the N64 and sold very well. It
                        also
                        got online support in 2005, which <br>
                        allowed you to play games like Mario Kart with other people from around the world. Their new
                        console
                        the Wii (released in 2006) had a <br>
                        pretty unique concept, the controller was an remote which had sensores that allowed the console
                        to
                        track your movement. Unlike the <br>
                        Gamecube it managed to beat the rival companies Sony and Microsoft. In 2009 the Wii and DS had a
                        Market value of 48 % (Wii) and 68 % (DS). <br>

                        Like the Game Boy the Nintendo DS also got a successor called the 3DS, it was able to play all
                        DS
                        Games and the new games could be <br>
                        played in 3D. In 2011 they held the first Nintendo Direct, which is a press conference where
                        they
                        reveal new games. A few new 3DS <br>
                        versions like the 3DS XL (a bigger version) or the 2DS (a cheaper version without 3D)
                        released.In
                        2012 the Wii U was released and <br>
                        against the id says, it was a whole new console and the addition was a touchscreen on the main
                        controller called GamePad. On the <br>
                        11th of July 2015 the Nintendo president Satoru Iwata died of cancer at the age of 55. Tatsumi
                        Kimishima became the new president. <br>
                        Nintendo started to develop some mobile games, one of them called Pokémon GO became a huge
                        success
                        and earned Nintendo a lot of <br>
                        Money. The next year their current console the Nintendo Switch released. It is a hybrid console
                        which can be used as a home console <br>
                        or a handheld. In 2018 the president Kimishima retired and was replaced by Shuntarō Furukawa.
